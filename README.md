# [Copy 2FA from Android Messages](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-2fa-from-android-messages/)

This extremely simple Firefox extension copies anything that looks like a 2FA
code from Android Messages to your clipboard, so you can stop switching tabs or
manually typing the code before the notification disappears.

## How do I use this?

Have Android Messages (https://messages.google.com/) open in a separate tab. Any
time a 2FA message is received, it will be copied to the clipboard. Paste it
where you need it.

## Privacy

The extension does not collect any data on you. All of your data stays between
you and your devices.

## Contributions welcome!

I'm developing this extension in my free time. Saying that, please report any
issues and feature requests here on GitHub, or send me pull requests, and I'll
try to get back to you as soon as possible!

Another way to contibute is to help with translations. Either by sending a pull
request with a new `messages.json` file as described in MDN's documentation on
[Internationalization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Internationalization#Providing_localized_strings_in__locales),
or by using the
[Web Extension Translator](https://lusito.github.io/web-ext-translator?gh=https://github.com/danielrozenberg/copy-2fa-from-android-messages)
online tool and submitting the translation on GitHub with the (â†’) right arrow
button on the top.
